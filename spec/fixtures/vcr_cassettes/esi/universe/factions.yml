        by Intaki exiles from the Gallente Federation during the Caldari-Gallente
        War. The Syndicate has slowly grown in stature and influence and now serves
        as an important link between the empires and the illegal elements in the outer
        regions. Syndicate space is a pirate haven, but still retains enough civility
        to allow pretty much anyone to travel there to do business. The Syndicate
        markets are always chockfull of contraband goods and illegal wares that are
        hard or impossible to come by elsewhere. Each Syndicate station is an autonomous
        entity, but they cooperate on security and information issues. The unofficial
        leader of the Syndicate is Silphy en Diabel, a former Sister of EVE that returned
        to Syndicate space to save her family''s fortune. Since then she''s turned
        out to be just as resourceful and ruthless as her late father.","faction_id":500009,"is_unique":true,"name":"The

        to heaven - that god resides on the other side of the gate. As well as dedicating
